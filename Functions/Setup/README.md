# "analysisSetup.R" includes all libraries and variables needed to run the functions
# "hindcastDataRetrieval.R" generates specifically hindcast CSV years to make analysis easier (may be useful to have)
# "makeLocationCSV.R" generates the overarching list of locations and coordinates. Edit this R script to
# append/change the locations of interest for the functions to run.
